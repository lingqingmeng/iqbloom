### You are bombarded with misleading information ###
Compared to the amount of talk floating around in blogs, magazines, videos... there is so much misleading advice about diet. The sad truth is, misleading information is more profittable. If everyone did thing's right, there would be a billion dollar fitness industry.


### Academic research link for each assertion ###
One huge difference between my articles and the mainstream is each article's points are backed by scientific research. Furthermore, I will actually break down what those articles are trying to say in laymens terms. 


### Take your nutrition and exercise education seriously ###
Most people go through a haze of clicking on whatever catchy article they see first and blindly adding whatever 'fixes' that article preaches to create this odd frankenstein-mixtape of half-fake diet advice. (I say half fake because there is probably some ounce of truth in them).


### What can I offer? ###
The goal of this blog is to help you sift out bad diet articles from the good ones, and to teach you all the hard-earned lessons I've gained while self experimenting. I've narrowed down 6 of the easiest to implement diet changes that also had the most dramatic improvements on my physical and mental state. Most people try to learn and apply way too much at once. If you're not reaching intermediate level goals, it makes more sense to perfect the basics. Let's begin.

1. Track your macros everyday
---
Most people overestimate their ability for a certain task - this is called the Dunning-Kruger effect. For this context, people 'remember' how they tracked their macros perfectly for 2 weeks yet are surprised when they step on the scale 2 weeks later with nothing to show for progress. You never hear the opposite, someone who pulls out their daily nutrition logs - showing their macro ratios each day down to the milligram, and then proclaiming no progress. 


A common newbie mistake is that they eat way too much protein and not enough fat and carbs. IMO, unless you are extremely gifted genetically, or are on some serious anabolics, your body can't use up 1 g/lb bodyweight of protein. Your protein intake should be between .6g/lb bodyweight to .9 g/lb bodyweight. 


More fat is more testosterone. Imagine having a protein intake that's too high for you, and a fat intake that's too low for you. Your body's testosterone levels are suboptimal - and becaues of that, your body is unable to use the excess protein and it all goes to waste down the toilet. 

Then imagine the alternative choice, erring on the side of higher fat less protein (without going above your basal metabolic rate). Your testosterone levels are close to 100%, your muscles hungrily absorb all the protein in you give to your body, at the highest possible rate (since protein absorbtion is dependent on test levels). After a few days, you realize your progressing on your lifts, but your muscles are getting pretty sore and are starving for more protein to rebuild themselves. This is an honest signal - and you know exactly what to do to tweak your diet. It can be as simple as adding a half scoop more protein into your daily shake. 

You should never go under 40 grams of fat at any point. As a natural lifter, 

Some common rules of thumbs
*   Bulking less protein, cutting more protein
*   More active day job = more carbs
*   Less carbs for sedentary occupation

2. Eat at least 6 organic pasture eggs a day
---
Eggs are not only the cheapest unprocessed protein source, but also with the most benefits. Cholesterol is the basic building block for testosterone and other essential hormones your endocrine system creates. As stated by natural bodybuilder Vince Gironda, 'a large amount of fertile eggs is equal to Dianabol in effectiveness'. 

Egg's also have higher bioavailability (ratio of protein content/protein that can be utilized by the body).

3. Replace all cooking/salad oils you currently have with the organic oils listed below.
---
Polyunsaturated fats (with the exception of DHA containing Omega 3's) are notoriously bad for hormone health. Most cheap vegetable oils (corn, soy, canola, etc) are heavily processed. 

Common dressings and oils have huge amounts of processed oils, and terrible omega 3:6 ratio (they are heavy on Omega 6). Not to mention a number of them contain phytoestrogens. The following oils promote anabolic activity, thermogensis(aka turn up your body to burn more fat), and a cardiovascular benefits.

*   Coconut oil
*   Grassfed butter
*   Unrefined extra virgin olive oil
*   Hemp oil
*   Organic sans antibiotic animal fats 
*   MCT oil

For those their favorite salad dressings... make them at home! Any vinegar based sauce with less than 5 calories is totally fine too. Italian dressing is Vinegar + (Olive)Oil. Feel free to mix and match organic herbs to the sauce to create the healthy alternative. E.g. oil + vinegar + hot pepper + garlic = healthy asian hot sauce (as opposed to the asian sauces you see the ethnic section in grocery stores). 


4. Favor vegetables and fruit over grains, no corn.
---
Grains cause inflammation of varyind degree, and contain high amounts of phytic acid, an anti nutrient (this blocks your digestive system from absorbing key minerals) From now on, when you go to the grocery store you will google 'is XYZ a grain?', if YES. DO NOT BUY IT. If you are bulking, you may not be getting adequete carb intake with only fruits and vegetables. Here: I've assembled a list of high carb sources that aren't grains. 

*   Potatos / Sweet potato
*   Quinoa
*   Oatmeal
*   Sorghum
*   Wild rice (completely different plant family than traditional rice)

Fruits/Vegetables with relatively high carbs content, that are also great for testosterone production. Not to mention these are common meal side items in many countries.
*   Onions
*   Garlic
*   Seaweed aka Kelp or Wakame
*   Pineapple
*   Avocado
*   Dark berries

Key takeaway: No rice no corn. No cheap processed oils. You get what you pay for.


5. No more estrogen infested plastic in the kitchen
---
Replace all coated pans with their stainless steel, porceilan, or cast iron equivalent. Replace all plastic tupperware with microwave/oven safe glass variants. Replace all plastic water bottles with stainless steel versions. 


6. Limit eating out and buy antibiotic free
---
I rank antibiotic free > organic if you had to choose. Ideally you'll want both. Antibiotics will destroy your gut bacteria that is essential for testosterone production, digestion, and overall feelings of wellbeing.
