Neurotransmitters are responsible for your emotional states. You've probably heard of them before: Dopamine, Gaba, Serotonin, Noepinephrine. By knowing how to manipulate your neurotransmitter levels, you're able to manipulate your own emotional state. This skill is a staple for anyone in high performance professions: Police, Lawyers, Performing artists like Singers and Actors, and basically anyone who is a pro athlete. 

### Quick Background

#### 1. Dopamine: 
Your brain's primary neurotransmitter for motivation, focus, and long term planning. Dopamine dominant people tend to be type A, goal driven with some obsessive-compulsive tendencies. CEO's, Bodybuilders, Salesmen are typically dopamine dominated. They love seeing incremental improvements in their lives and those jobs are a perfect platform for that. Their detail orientedness comes in handy when dealing with all the subtleties required for the professions listed. 

#### 2. Serotonin: 
Responsible for feelings of satisfaction, pleasure, connectedness. Having low serotonin levels is linked to clinical depression, but that is just part of the picture. For example, a person who is normally dopamine dominant but has a serotonin crash (loss of family member, breakup, etc) won't necc. be depressed; but he/she is moreso in a state of constant, meaningless tedious work just to distract them from their pain. Or for someone with naturally lower serotonin (but otherwise normal); they may end up chasing goals/rewards simply because they are never satisfied with their life. Each new milestone for them is just another item to cross off their neverending list of things they think will make them happy. 

#### 3. Gaba: 
The inhibitory neurotransmitter. With high levels of Gaba your fears and worries seem distant. You're able to be more expressive, jolly but also angry, disgusted depending on what the situation calls for. Those emotions are commonly repressed, so a strength of having high gaba is that there are less emotions bottled up - which can cause an extreme amount of stress if they aren't released.

#### 4. Nonepinephrine: 
Used commonly with 'adrenaline', this neurotransmitter is used to put your body in a state of fight-or-flight. 


So how do neurotransmitters work? I won't give you a monster textbook definition, here's all you need to know: They are chemicals released between nerve cells in order to pass a message to an entire nerve. Neurons are your brain cells, and they essentially regulate your thoughts, mood, emotions. When neurotransmitters gets released onto a neuron, it changes how a neuron responds to inputs. Having an inbalance of neurotransmitters lead to mental disorders such as ADHD, Parkinsons, OCD, Depression, etc. 

How is this relevant. Well whenever you hear or see dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, or serotinin re-uptake inhibitor you usually associate those to big pharma drugs right? Well it turns out that if some substance X-neurotransmitter re-uptake inhibitor can make a person feel a certain way without having any side effects (or it only affects .0001% of the population), certain companies and make tons of money off people.

The problem with re-uptake inhibitors is the law of homeostasis, the body always seek to return to its baseline. Basically, they are a costly band-aid that won't actually solve the deeper problem at hand. And abusing them will lead to addiction.

What they don't tell you is that even though they aren't a long term solution, by understanding basic neuroscience you can use them in a way that's the most beneficial (take a dopamine reuptake inhibitor during long study sessions), and accelerate the recovery process and go back to homeostasis 3x sooner(take the opposite, a NDMA antagonist such as memantine), albeit at the cost of extremely reduced dopamine function.

Now that's just an example and I do not recommend doing that at all. 

By understanding each neurotransmitter, and having enough emotional awareness to know when one (or a combination) of them is dominant, you are better able to not get lost in those thoughts. I constantly struggled with depression and anhedonia (lack of serotonin AND dopamine) until I realized what that really means: My dopamine and serotonin pathways are down regulated. I did some research online and found the following to greatly aid my recovery process:

Serotonin: Greek yoghut, raw cacao nibs, sauerkraut, tryptophan supplements.
Dopamine: Uridine, DHA (fish oil), Choline, Phosphatidylserine, HIIT exercise, Meditation
Treating CNS fatigue due to low neurotransmitter levels and physical stress: Creatine, Melatonin for 8-10 hour daily naps.
