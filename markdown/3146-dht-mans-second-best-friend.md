If Testosterone is man's best friend...
---
then DHT is man's second best friend, and also third best friend, and holds positions 4th 5th and 6th as well! 

One of the most misunderstood hormones in the body is DHT. We hear it pop up in discussions about hairloss, creatine, and even anabolic substances (is it even natty?!). The main androgen that our testes produce is testosterone, and it's used in signaling muscle growth. However in most other parts of the body, the androgen signaler is actually DHT. The relationship between the two is that Testosterone acts as a prohormone that gets converted into DHT via the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. 

So in essence, DHT is a super potent non-aromatizing androgen. In other words, it does not get converted to estrogen, unlike testosterone. You can think of these hormones as keys, and the receptors for hormones are locks. The keys (hormones) fit the locks (receptors) and unlock the mechanism inside. So let's give an example of DHT in action. 


Key differences between T and DHT
---
In the central nervous system (CNS) especially the brain androgen (T) receptors are located densely in special areas. T and other male hormones (androgens) are able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and interact with their appropriate central nervous system (CNS) receptors. Androgen receptors are found in the cortex, medulla, amygdala (an emotional center). The brain area called the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland are very dense in androgen receptors. Via these brain regions androgens along with other hormones are able to regulate secretion of androgens.

Testosterone is a prohormone meaning it is a hormone that gets converted to another hormones. Testosterone gets converted to 2 powerful metabolites: dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E) by the aromataze enzyme, which converts T to E and is found in areas that are essential to neuroendocrine control.

Testosterone gets converted to DHT via the enzyme 5 alpha reductase. DHT is 2.5 times more potent in having androgenic effects then T does. [1] Many do not realize that. 


DHT effects on Sexual Health
---
We all know that frequent sexual activity increases testosterone levels. DHT has profound psychosexual effects. When men are treated with Proscar (Finasteride) and Avodart (Dutasteride) or other such drugs, which block the synthesis of DHT there is a loss of libido and sexual function despite a small rise in T. Which means DHT is necessary for good sexual function. 

Androgens (T) are well known to be essential for sexuality and cognition. But without the presence of E androgens essentially have little or no sexual or cognitive effects. It has been shown that when you drop E to zero using aromatase inhibitor drugs like Arimidex (Anastrazole) there is a great reduction of cognition and also sexual desire and function.


DHT effects on muscle strength and growth:
---
In this context, the results of a 2010 study from the Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Research Institute at the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, is of particular significance [2]. Using isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL, a mainly fast twitch muscle in adult mice) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL, a mainly fast twitch muscle in adult mice) muscles from male and female mice, M.M. Hamdi and G. Mutungi established that the strength promoting effects of DHT are mediated mainly via the ERK, i.e. the extracellular signal-regulating kinase (also known as MAPK), pathway and thusly in a non-androgen receptor mediated way.

In a trial on the effects of DHT administration on prostate growth in 114 healthy men over 50 and found neither beneficial nor negative effects on prostate growth (aka don't worry about prostate cancer) and a very modest increase in lean mass (2.4%) in response to 70mg DHT gel for 2 years (!). 

in a 3 month trial using transdermal DHT Ly et al  found a reduction in body fat mass and improved isokinetic knee flexion strength of the dominant leg (Ly. 2001);

Muscle strength measured by isokinetic peak torque was increased in flexion of the dominant knee [4]

Actionable steps to boost DHT
---
So what are some basic steps I can take to maximize the effects of DHT? Best way to do so naturally would be to have a diet with foods that naturally promote the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. One such supplement is Creatine:
Creatine supplementation was recently studied in healthy young rugby-playing males and found to increase by 56% during the 25 gram loading phase and 40% during the 5 gram maintenance phase. [5] In addition, the testosterone-to-DHT ratio increased by 22%, which indicates that there was increased 5-alpha reductase activity.

Another food contains enzyme which boost 5-a-reductase is Sorghum: 
This was seen in a study conducted by Sinnecker et al. They found out that sorghum increased 5-a enzyme expression by 54% in vitro [6]

Oatmeal is another compound that increases DHT. Oatmeal has compounds called avenacosides that bind to sex hormone binding globulin. (SHBG) SHBG binds to your free testosterone (which is what increases sex drive, burns fat and builds muscle) and renders it useless. (not good) But oatmeal binds to SHBG and this allows more free testosterone to be used and converted into DHT.  Awesome!

So in conclusion, supplement with creatine if you haven't already. I eat organic produce because pesticides and antibiotics impact for your gut/digestive system negatively, and their origins are easily verified for safe farming practices. 

My favorite brand of oatmeal (tastiest) : http://amzn.to/1QQJsnE
I want my creatine tasteless; artificial sweeteners impact insulin sensitivty negatively. ON is a trusted brand and has very fair prices:

Optional: 

Since my 2 main source of carbs are Sorghum and Oats, I usually buy them in bulk to save money. This one is a pack of 4 for roughly $23. At most super markets a single 24 oz pack of sorghum is around $9, so about $13 worth of saving here: http://amzn.to/1FjwtqC
