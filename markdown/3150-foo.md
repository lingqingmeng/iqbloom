Neurotransmitters are responsible for your emotional states. You've probably heard of them before: Dopamine, Gaba, Serotonin, Noepinephrine. By knowing how to manipulate your neurotransmitter levels, you're able to manipulate your own emotional state. This skill is a staple for anyone in high performance professions: Police, Lawyers, Performing artists like Singers and Actors, and basically anyone who is a pro athlete. 

### Quick Background

#### 1. Dopamine: 
Your brain's primary neurotransmitter for motivation, focus, and long term planning. Dopamine dominant people tend to be type A, goal driven with some obsessive-compulsive tendencies. CEO's, Bodybuilders, Salesmen are typically dopamine dominated. They love seeing incremental improvements in their lives and those jobs are a perfect platform for that. Their detail orientedness comes in handy when dealing with all the subtleties required for the professions listed. 

#### 2. Serotonin: 
Responsible for feelings of satisfaction, pleasure, connectedness. Having low serotonin levels is linked to clinical depression, but that is just part of the picture. For example, a person who is normally dopamine dominant but has a serotonin crash (loss of family member, breakup, etc) won't necc. be depressed; but he/she is moreso in a state of constant, meaningless tedious work just to distract them from their pain. Or for someone with naturally lower serotonin (but otherwise normal); they may end up chasing goals/rewards simply because they are never satisfied with their life. Each new milestone for them is just another item to cross off their neverending list of things they think will make them happy. 

#### 3. Gaba: 
The inhibitory neurotransmitter. With high levels of Gaba your fears and worries seem distant. You're able to be more expressive, jolly but also angry, disgusted depending on what the situation calls for. Those emotions are commonly repressed, so a strength of having high gaba is that there are less emotions bottled up - which can cause an extreme amount of stress if they aren't released.

#### 4. Nonepinephrine: 
Used commonly with 'adrenaline', this neurotransmitter is used to put your body in a state of fight-or-flight.
