Intermittent fasting is one of those things that everyone should try out for at least a month. When perfected, its one of the few ways one can reach the holy grail of bodybuilding - cut fat and gain muscle at the same time. But the main reason I fast is how it strengthens my willpower. Having a strong willpower gives you the abiliy to plow through common ailments (morning grogginess, depression, social anxiety, brain fog) that hold us back from our potential. 

Let me explain it as succinctly as I can. To do IF, you can 
A - Everyday, Eat food only in 8 out of the 24 hours of the day. The most common eating window is from 1 PM to 9 PM. 
B - Twice a week, don't eat for a period of 24 hours. 

So what makes Intermittent Fasting (IF) so good? Have you ever looked in the fridge and was like - I ran out of X ingredient, I am so sick of cooking! Or if you prepare meals - 'This 3 day old chicken looks like cardboard'. 

Intermittent fasting allows you to make the most out of your cooking. You are able to feast when your food is fresh off the pan. You only need to cook one big meal a day, and your leftovers are from the same day - as fresh as possible.
