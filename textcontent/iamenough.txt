what to remember when i doubt myself:

-people can't tell who's site is more legit as long as I talk about my 'experienced background' and how long i've been running
-goal is to get as many social media followers as possible - get that as a step in the compliance ladder when I go out gaming
-i can do what a team of 6 can. I can program, write, (hire a sexy photographer)
